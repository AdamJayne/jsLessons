Adding onto challenge One,
Students need to make a section of the react application that links from the main page ( add another bullet )

They then need got reach out to SWAPI using a fetch() and get data for both starsips and planets. Then return that data into the application, and render it to the page.

There needs to be a button to toggle between starship and planet data.

Students also need to make use of the style prop

const divStyles = {
    borderRadius: '1em',
    // whatEver: whatever
}

ex <div style={divStyles} ></div>

Note:: SWAPI buckled during the initial run, so planets.js and starships.js contain JSON formats of the information return by SWAPI -- just in case.
