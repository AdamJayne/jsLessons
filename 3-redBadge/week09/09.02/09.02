Angular Challenge

Create an angular application (clean out the boilerplate stuff) that has a dropdown for these values:

People 
Ships 
Films 

Then create a input field that a user can put in a search term

Then a button that sends a service action that sends a get request to this url

https://swapi.co/api/people/?search=r2

Make the dropdown values (people, ships, films) fit into the api with on click, and the r2 as the search term in the box

Show the data that comes back from the api as a list

Garden Project (Team git with Angular):

A client has come to you and asked you to make a website with the following:
A nice logo (make something up => doesn't need to be pretty)
A home page talking about the company
A products page talking about the products
And a about page talking about the client

Use Angular to create the site
Use git to push to a single repo on GitHub
Make it look nice

Presentations for the 'client' will be tomorrow before lunch
