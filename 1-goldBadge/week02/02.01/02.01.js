/*
Challenge (Strings):
Pascal Case:

Create a function that takes in strings
In the function, translate the string to Pascal Casing, which means the first letter of 
each word in a string is capitalized. 

Lets walk through some first steps to solving this problem. 
1. What is the problem we need to solve? 
    We need to take in a string, and give back another string that capitalizes the first letter of 
    each word. 
2. What tools will we need? 
    We need tools that address three main issues: 
    A) Separate words in a string
    B) Capitolize each one of those words
    C) Join that string back together and return the string
3. Where do we start to solve this problem? 
    Starting is the simplest part, we know we need a function and we know that function needs 
    to take in a parameter
